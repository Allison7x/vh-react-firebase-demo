# VenusHacks React + Firebase Demonstration

Welcome! This is a todo list web application that will interact with
Firebase, a collection of cloud services that includes authentication and
databases.

The VenusHacks workshop will primarily focus on integrating Firebase
authentication (specifically user/email authentication) as well as Cloud
Firestore, a NoSQL document-based database.
