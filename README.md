# VenusHacks React + Firebase Demonstration

Welcome! This is an unfinished todo web application that will interact with
Firebase, a collection of cloud services that includes authentication and
databases. This tutorial will primarily focus on integrating Firebase
authentication (specifically user/email authentication) as well as Cloud
Firestore, a NoSQL document-based database.

## Steps

1. Install Firebase with `npm`
2. Create project on Firebase console
3. Store Firebase credentials in environment variables
4. Create file for Firebase exports
5. Modify application so that it can store and fetch items on to our todo list
